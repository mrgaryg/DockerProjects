This is my experimental work on deployin Docker containers using Vagrant as provisioner/provider

The work is largely inspired by the following blogs
 1. [First steps with provisioning of Docker containers using Vagrant as provider](https://technology.amis.nl/2015/08/22/first-steps-with-provisioning-of-docker-containers-using-vagrant-as-provider/ "Part 1")
 2. [Vagrant and Docker â€“ Next and Advanced steps with folders, ports, volumes, linking and more](https://technology.amis.nl/2015/08/25/vagrant-and-docker-next-and-advanced-steps-with-folders-ports-volumes-linking-and-more/ "Part 2")
